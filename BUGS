#1 [SOLVED] Typo in exception raise when as_of and most_recent invoked without an instance
#2 Foreign Keys are not time-aware. instance.as_of(date).fk should return
   fk.as_of(date) if history is present for fkk too, fk otherwise.
#3 [SOLVED] If fk.related_name is set (i.e. to reverse_fk) model does not validate
