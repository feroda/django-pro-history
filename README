Django History has been taken from "Pro Django"
===============================================

The main author of Django History is Marty Alchin in its great book "Pro Django".

This fascinating module (battery?) adds generic history support for models.
This is achieved simple by adding a manager to the model.

I have improved it making Django History time-aware also of foreign keys
then I have tried to contact Marty, but with no success, 
so I decided (too much time later...) to publish my own fork.

I publish my updates with AGPLv3. I can't find Marty license statements.
